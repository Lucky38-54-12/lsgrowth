  <p>Hey {{contact_name}},</p>
  <p>Quick one. In the last 30 days we generated 57 new window cleaning and house cleaning enquiries for Queenstown Cleaning, working out at around $7 to $11 per lead, and 30 of those have already turned into booked, paying jobs.</p>
  <p>{{personalization}}</p>

  <p>Hey {{contact_name}},</p>
  <p>Just bumping this up in case it got buried. The core idea is simple — most {{trade}} businesses lose enquiries just because nobody gets back within the hour. Our system responds in under 60 seconds and handles all the follow up automatically, so you're converting leads you'd otherwise lose.</p>

  <p>Hey {{contact_name}},</p>
  <p>Wanted to share one more example. In Queenstown Cleaning's first week running our system they got 19 new enquiries, and 8 of those turned into paid, booked jobs by the end of the week.</p>
  <p>The reason it works is speed. New leads get a personalised text back within 60 seconds, before they've had a chance to call someone else. Most {{trade}} businesses respond hours later (or not at all) so the job's already gone by then.</p>
  <p>If {{company}} wants a consistent flow of jobs without chasing quotes, worth a <a href="{{cta_link}}">quick 15 min look</a>.</p>

  <p>Quick one. Most plumbing jobs get called out to 3-4 different companies before someone picks up the phone. If you're not responding within 30 minutes, the job's already gone.</p>
  <p>We run a lead gen + fast response system for plumbers across NZ: every new enquiry gets contacted within 30 minutes, then we handle all the follow-up automatically. One client went from 15 jobs/month to 40+ booked jobs within 60 days.</p>

  <p>One more example. Local plumbing business in Wellington was getting 12-15 calls a month but only booking 5-6 because responses were too slow. After we set up the auto-response system, they booked 25 jobs in the first 30 days.</p>
  <p>Speed wins in plumbing. Be the first call back and you get the job.</p>
